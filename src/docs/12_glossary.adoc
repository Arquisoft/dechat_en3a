|*Functional Requirements*
|They state what the system must do operating within normal parameters, so as to assure the design is adequate to make the desired product and the end product reaches its potential of the design in order to meet user expectations. Functionality does not determine 
architecture.

|*Quality Attribute Requiremennts*

They influence the architecture: Availability, modifiability, usability... .

|*Quality Attribute Scenarios*
|They Describe a certain event (triggered by a person or a system) of the system and a

|*Test coverage*
|It is a measure used to describe the degree to which the source code of a program is executed when a particular test suite runs. A program with high test coverage, measured as a percentage, has had more of its source code executed during testing, which suggests it has a lower chance of containing undetected software bugs compared to a program with low test coverage.

|*Cucumber*
