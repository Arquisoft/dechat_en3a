The goal is to create a decentralized chat app based on the solid specifications. The system will be based on a decentralized architecture where data storage is separated from the app. Users can store their chat data in their own pods. The app will allow a user to share pictures, videos or other kinds of files with other friends through the chat. A user can also get notifications when some friend wants to chat with him. Users can have groups of friends with whom they may want to chat and it will be possible to have group chats where all members receive the messages.

We will have two users (at least) sending and receiving messages, while in the background, RDF will be sharing chat details. The data that the users will exchange will be kept in PODs.

* Sender: User of the application that sends a message to other user.
* Receiver: User in the application that receives a message from other user.

As the architecture of DeChat is SOLID, we'll be using WebID to communicate between users and friends. In addition, SOLID uses WebSockets, RDF...
