== System Scope and Context

****

The goal is to create a decentralized chat app based on the solid specifications. The system will be based on a decentralized architecture where data storage is separated from the app. Users can store their chat data in their own pods. The app will allow a user to share pictures, videos or other kinds of files with other friends through the chat. A user can also get notifications when some friend wants to chat with him. Users can have groups of friends with whom they may want to chat and it will be possible to have group chats where all members receive the messages.

.Contents
Technical interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking your system to its environment. In addition a mapping of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which channel.

.Motivation
Many stakeholders make architectural decision based on the technical interfaces between the system and its context. Especially infrastructure or hardware designers decide these technical interfaces.

.Form
E.g. UML deployment diagram describing channels to neighboring systems,
together with a mapping table showing the relationships between channels and input/output.
