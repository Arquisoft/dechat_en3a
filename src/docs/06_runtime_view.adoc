*Sequence of a chat*

1. First User_1 sends a message to User_2
2. The application of the User_1 posts its message on the pod of the User_2
3. The application of the User_2 requests the received messages that contains its pod, so the pod makes the messages available for the application
4. Finally User_2 reads the received messages from the application
