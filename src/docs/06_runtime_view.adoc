=== Add friends
Every user must have any friend added in the chat so they can chat one to each other.
When the user signs up for the first time, it won't have any friend

1. One of the users must enter the url of the pod of the other user, the one who asks for adding the first user as a friend
2. After that, the first user friend's url is stored on its pod so they can chat one to each other

=== Chat with friends
The chat is used for chatting between users, better said, between friends.

*Sequence of a chat*

1. First User_1 sends a message to User_2
2. The application of the User_1 posts its message on the pod of the User_2
3. The application of the User_2 requests the received messages that contains its pod, so the pod makes the messages available for the application
4. Finally User_2 reads the received messages from the application
