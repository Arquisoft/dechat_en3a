== Runtime View


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The runtime view describes concrete behavior and interactions of the systemâ€™s building blocks in form of scenarios from the following areas:

* important use cases or features: how do building blocks execute them?
* interactions at critical external interfaces: how do building blocks cooperate with users and neighboring systems?
* operation and administration: launch, start-up, stop
* error and exception scenarios

Remark: The main criterion for the choice of possible scenarios (sequences, workflows) is their *architectural relevance*. It is *not* important to describe a large number of scenarios. You should rather document a representative selection.

.Motivation
You should understand how (instances of) building blocks of your system perform their job and communicate at runtime.
You will mainly capture scenarios in your documentation to communicate your architecture to stakeholders that are less willing or able to read and understand the static models (building block view, deployment view).

.Form
There are many notations for describing scenarios, e.g.

* numbered list of steps (in natural language)
* activity diagrams or flow charts
* sequence diagrams
* BPMN or EPCs (event process chains)
* state machines
* ...

== Add friends
Every user must have any friend added in the chat so they can chat one to each other.
When the user signs up for the first time, it won't have any friend

1. One of the users must enter the url of the pod of the other user, the one who asks for adding the first user as a friend
2. After that, the first user friend's url is stored on its pod so they can chat one to each other

=== Chat with friends
The chat is used for chatting between users, better said, between friends.

*Sequence of a chat*

1. First User_1 sends a message to User_2
2. The application of the User_1 posts its message on the pod of the User_2
3. The application of the User_2 requests the received messages that contains its pod, so the pod makes the messages available for the application
4. Finally User_2 reads the received messages from the application
