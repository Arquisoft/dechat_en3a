== Deployment View

The deployment view is very easy to describe in a decentralized chat because we are just focusing in the interaction between the users 
and SOLID providers

=== Infrastructure Level 1

In our decentralized system the users send message through the chat application to the the SOLID provider that is the one that has the
POD where the messages are going to be store. It's a simple diagram

== Motivation

We want to establish a communication between the users based on their pods.

== Quality and/or Performance Features

Once deployed we can't do very much here, if the user has a powerful system then the performace will be higher
and lower otherwise
