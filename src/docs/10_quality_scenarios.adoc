=== Quality Scenarios

Testability / Coverage
By using JSCoverage and Istanbul during development and the build process ensure a code coverage of at least 95%.

Testability / Independent from external services
The architecture should be designed in such a way that algorithms depending on external services can be tested without having the external service available. That is: All external dependencies should be mockable.
