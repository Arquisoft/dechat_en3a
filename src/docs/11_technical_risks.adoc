.Data bases
  We had some problems at the time of decide which database we use because not all of us has used the 
  same kind of databases. 
  We have de idea that using a NoSQL systema but we are low experimented with them so we decide to learn 
  abaout it because is the best option for a solid system.
  
.Solid
  We have some problems about using solid due to is a new technology so there is not such kind of information as 
  other technologies. By the way we have the solid system so we can ask there some questions but at the time of 
  programming the final application we have some doubts.
  
.Javascript
  As i said with solid, we have the same problem with javascript. We all know this language but we are not 
  experts using it so we have some problemas at the time of starting the prototype of the application.
