== Introduction and Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
Describes the relevant requirements and the driving forces that software architects and development team must consider. These include

* Underlying business goals, essential features and functional requirements for the system
* Quality goals for the architecture
* Relevant stakeholders and their expectations

*Requirements*

*Quality Goals*

** Runtime quality attributes

*** Performance: Shows the response of the system to performing certain actions for a certain period of time.

*** Security: Is responsible for the ability of the system to reduce the likelihood of malicious or accidental actions as well as the possibility of theft or loss of information.

*** Availability: Is part of reliability and is expressed as the ratio of the available system time to the total working time.

*** Usability: Is one of the most important attributes, because, unlike in cases with other attributes, users can see directly how well this attribute of the system is worked out. One of the key problems of usability is too much interaction or too many actions necessary to accomplish a task. Incorrect sequences of steps in multistage interfaces are also a problem of usability. Data elements and controls may be designed not according to the accepted patterns of user experience, which also complicates the interaction.

*** Scalability: is the ability of the system to handle load increases without decreasing performance, or the possibility to rapidly increase the load.

** Non-runtime quality attributes

*** Modifiability: Determines how many common changes need to be made to the system to make changes to each individual item. Ideal is the case where each change affects only one element.

*** Maintainability: Is the ability of the system to support changes. Changes can be related to new business requirements or correction of old errors and affect system components or separate methods. Also, maintainability affects the time needed to restore the system after a failure. Excessive dependencies between components have a very negative effect on maintainability.

*** Portability:  In high-level computer programming is the usability of the same software in different environments.

*** Supportability: Is the ability of the system to provide useful information for identifying and solving problems. 

*** Reusability: Is a chance of using a component or system in other components/systems with small or no change. Allocation of responsibilities, modularization, decreasing of copy-paste are all about reusability. Copying code, or worse, using different components for the same result in different places, is one of the biggest problems of reusability.

*** Testability: Shows how well the system allows performing tests, according to predefined criteria. In addition to testing performance, testability makes it possible to effectively divide the system into subsystems.

** Business quality attributes

*** Cost and benefit. The development effort will naturally have a budget that must not be exceeded. Different architectures will yield different development costs.

*** Rollout schedule. If a product is to be introduced as base functionality with many features released later, the flexibility and customizability of the architecture are important.

*** Time-to-market:The development effort will naturally have a budget that must not be exceeded. Different architectures will yield different development costs.

=== Requirements Overview

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

Writing here

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.

=== Quality Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals. They are not necessarily identical.

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged â€¦

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities
****

=== Stakeholders

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* Jose Emilio Labra Gayo: He should know the architecture and be convinced of it, and he also needs to know the doumentation about the project.

* Teamwork: Needs to know everything about the project and have the power to take decissions of how the project is gonna be manage.

* Client: The client just needs to know how the application works.

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.

|Stakeholder|Description| Expectations
| Jose Emilio Labra Gayo | Supervisor | This client expects improving our knowledge in solid and develop a funcional decentralized chat application
| Teamwork | Group developing the application | Develop a functional application that allow us to pass the course
